One of signals in technical analysis is Relative Strength Index (RSI) that is a well versed momentum based oscillator which is used to measure the speed (velocity) as well as the change (magnitude) of directional price movements. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100. Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI are that values of 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued and may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. An RSI reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold or undervalued condition.
